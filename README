Lplex is a console application meant to provide a free, quick, and hopefully 
painless way to

    Create lossless "audio-only" dvd-video discs from wav or flac audio files,
    featuring 
        gapless playback.
        md5 verification of audio data.
        archival (dvd-rom) content.

    Losslessly extract unencrypted lpcm audio streams from dvd-video to wav or
    flac format.

You're already fully equipped for hi-res audio (up to 24-bit/96khz) if you 
have a typical dvd-player and digital amp, and lplex is a way to take 
advantage of this.
